# MAERSK-Case-Study
The Maersk case study focuses on optimizing operations at a container terminal. It involves simulating key processes to ensure efficiency and minimize bottlenecks. The main elements include:

* Vessel Arrivals: Ships arrive at random intervals, carrying a fixed number of containers.
* Berthing: Two berths are available for docking, where vessels wait if both are occupied.
* Unloading: Each vessel is unloaded using quay cranes, with operations timed per container.
* Transportation: Trucks transport containers from the berth to the yard, with specific turnaround times.

The study aims to model these operations using SimPy, evaluating resource utilization and identifying potential improvements in terminal performance.
